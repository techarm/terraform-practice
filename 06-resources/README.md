Steps for implementation:

- [x] Deploy a VPC and subnet
- [x] Deploy an internet gateway and associate it with the VPC
- [x] Setup a route table with a route to the IGW and associate it with the subnet
- [x] Deploy an EC2 instance inside of the created subnet and associate a public IP
- [x] Associate a public IP and security group that allows public ingress
- [x] Change the EC2 instance to use a publicy avaliable NGINX AMI
- [x]] Destroy everything
